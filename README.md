# JavaScript-Quizzes-hands-on-

I hope these mini-quizzes are helpful! They are designed for advanced beginners and intermediate JavaScripters. 

Each mini-quiz is six questions: Three are short text answer/fill-in-the-blank/multiple choice. 
Three are actual coding questions. My suggested answers for the actual coding exercises are one of many solutions, so don't freak out if yours doesn't look like mine! But...If it doesn't compile in your console, you don't pass (i.e. try to redo the question until you get it right).

The inspiration came from Anthony Alicea's Udemy course, "JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts." I fire up Atom and complete them after watching/reading JavaScript material to test if I *really* know what's going on. I thought I was learning a ton of material, until I went to go try and code some of what he was talking about, without following along with his video. EPIC. FAIL! Coding these things without help, but in a familiar quiz format is really helping me. And I do hope it can help you, too!

---Don't give up if you get some of these wrong...Just keep trying until it feels good and it compiles correctly! Your hands and head will know when you're making progress---

Answers are intentionally further below questions so your eyes are less inclined to cheat.
