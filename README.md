# JavaScript-Quizzes-hands-on-

I hope these mini-quizzes are helpful! They are designed for advanced beginners. 

The inspiration came from Anthony Alicea's Udemy course, "JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts." I fire up Atom and complete them after watching/reading JavaScript material to 
test if I *really* know what's going on.  

Answers are intentionally further below questions so your eyes are less inclined to cheat.
